# Good-Things

This is an app which wants you to write at least one good thing that happened to you everyday. Keep a note collection of all the events that made you happy in a nice portable application. Re-reading a history of these kinds of events can really boost your mood! Inspired by the happiness jar that was really popular in 2013/2014. More features such as push notifications that encourage you to write in the app to be added later.
