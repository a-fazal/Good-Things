# Good-Things

This is an app which wants you to write at least one good thing that happened to you everyday. Keep a note collection of all the events that made you happy in a nice portable application. Re-reading a history of these kinds of events can really boost your mood! Inspired by the happiness jar that was really popular in 2013/2014. More features such as push notifications that encourage you to write in the app to be added later. App is being built with ionic framework, to test it out, download the zip and extract, then from the node.js command prompt run 'npm install -g cordova ionic' and cd to the directory, then run 'ionic serve --lab' and it should work.
